** THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION **

Ok, enough messing around... now let's get right into the details... This is a revolutionary program meant to explore topological relation between genetically defined agents. Using Bayes-like inferencing, their probability of survival will be evaluated in a real-time Monte Carlo approach, all the while the very probability of their survival is itself relient on the outcome of previous inferences in a Markov-chain fashion. Sound too complicated? Well, you might just be at the wrong repo...
